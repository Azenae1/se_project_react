# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
The weather data is set according to your location via the Openweather api.

## Project features

- The temperature updates every time the page is reloaded
- +Add clothes button that opens the form for adding new clothes to the pool
